Development Approach:

We need to approach this project in an organized manner to be able to complete it well.

We will be dividing this project into multiple parts and only moving on when that part is done.

This way we won't have any confusion on what parts we did or did not do since we will be working on one part

till it is done. We hope to create a project that is clean and well developed by taking our time with certain parts if it is needed.
