OS:

We initially considered using Ubuntu Server OS because we heard from ChatGPT and online searches that it is great for hosting a website, as it also doesn’t have a desktop interface, which saves resources. But then we found out by using the Raspberry Pi Imager that there were OS that were built for the Raspberry Pi, so we decided to switch to the Raspberry Pi OS Lite, which also doesn’t have a desktop environment.

Remote Connection:

To connect remotely to the homelab. We chose Tailscale because of its ease of use and security.

Programming Language: 

-Python

-Bash 
  
Frameworks:

-Frontend Framework: React

-Backend Framework: Flask (Python)
  
Development Approach:

We need to approach this project in an organized manner to be able to complete it well.

We will be dividing this project into multiple parts and only moving on when that part is done.

This way we won't have any confusion on what parts we did or did not do since we will be working on one part

till it is done. We hope to create a project that is clean and well developed by taking our time with certain parts if it is needed.
