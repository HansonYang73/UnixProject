# UnixProject
This project is about creating a full-stack website that's deployed from a home lab.
By using GitAction we will automatically apply the commits made to the home lab so that it is showed on the website if it passed the CI/CD tests.

It will be using a Raspberry Pi as the hardware for the home lab.
